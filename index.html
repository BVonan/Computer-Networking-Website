    <h2 id="sh">What Is It</h2>
    <p id="comal"> A <span>Computer Network</span> or data network is a type of telecommunications network that allows computers to share information. The connection between devices is either through cable or wireless media. The Internet is the most well-known computer network. The devices that transfer the data are called network nodes and can include personal computers, phones, servers, and other networking equipment. When two devices can exchange information, they are considered networked. Different computer networks have different communication mediums, protocols, sizes, and purposes. They support various applications and services, such as access to the internet, video and audio streaming, shared use of servers and printers, email, instant messaging, and many others. These applications often use specific communication protocols layered on top of more general ones.

    <h2 id="WDTD">What Do They Do </h2>
    <p id="CNP">Computer networks provide access to a vast range of applications and services, including the World Wide Web, digital video and audio, shared use of servers for applications and storage, printers and fax machines, email, instant messaging, and many others.</p>


    <h2 id="HTW">How They Work</h2>
    <p id="DSC">Devices such as computers, routers, and switches are connected in a computer network through the use of cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals. This enables communication and information sharing among the network's nodes. Communication within the network is governed by protocols, which outline the rules for sending and receiving data.</p>
