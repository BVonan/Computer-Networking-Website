<h2 id="WIS">What is it?</h2>
<p id="LAN1">
    A <span>Local Area Network (LAN)</span> is a group of interconnected devices within a confined area, such as a school, office, building, or home. Its main purpose is to share hardware resources such as printers, files, scanners, etc. The simplest example of a LAN network is a computer and a printer connected in a home. The data transmission speed in a LAN is typically up to 10 Mbps.
</p>

<h2 id="WDID">What does it do</h2>
<P id="LAN2">LANenables users to access internal servers, websites, and other LANs that are part of the same wide area network (WAN). The two primary methods for establishing LAN connections are Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Ethernet is a technology specified by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that enables communication between computers. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, uses radio waves in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum to connect computers to the LAN.</P>

<h2 id="HDIW">How does it Work</h2>
   <p id="LAN3"> 
 In most cases, local area networks (LANs) are connected to the Internet through a central device, such as a router. While a single router is sufficient for home LANs, larger spaces may utilize network switches to optimize packet delivery. LANs usually utilize Ethernet, WiFi, or both for connecting devices within the network. Ethernet is a protocol for physical network connections that requires the use of Ethernet cables, while WiFi is a protocol for connecting to a network using radio waves. A range of devices can be connected to LANs, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, printers, IoT devices, and even gaming consoles. In an office setting, LANs are often utilized to provide shared access to internal employees for connected printers or servers.
