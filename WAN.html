<h2 id="WIS2">What is it?</h2>

<p id="WAN1">A <span>Wide Area Network (WAN)</span>is a computer network that covers a large geographical area, such as a country or continent. It is larger than both LAN and MAN networks. A WAN network can be created by connecting two or more LANs using telephone lines or radio waves. Telecommunications networks are often considered as WAN networks.</p>   

<h2 id="WDID2">What does it do</h2>
<P id = "WAN2">A WAN is the infrastructure that links your various workplaces, data centers, cloud services, and cloud storage, across a wide geographic area, and sometimes even globally. WANs provide enhanced privacy and security, ensuring consistent network performance and enabling continuous access to the full bandwidth you have paid for, without having to compete with other Internet traffic.</P>

<h2 id="HDIW2">How does it Work</h2>
<p id = "WAN3">A WAN is the infrastructure that links multiple locations, such as offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage, over a wide geographical area, or even globally. It is referred to as a wide-area network due to its coverage beyond just one building or campus.</p>
