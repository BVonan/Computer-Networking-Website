<h2 id="WIS2" >What is it?</h2>

<P id="MAN1">   A <span>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</span>is a network that connects devices across an entire town, city, or small region. It is larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a wide area network (WAN). A WAN is used to connect devices over a large geographical area, such as across the country or continent. A MAN is located between a LAN and a WAN and can be used to connect multiple LANs. When one LAN uses modems, digital devices, and other media types to connect with another LAN, it covers a large area and is considered a MAN. </P>

<h2 id="WDID2">What does it do</h2>
<P id="MAN2">A metropolitan area network (MAN) can connect various systems, individuals, and equipment through the Internet of Things. With the right network setup, if a traffic light malfunctions on the outskirts of the city, the relevant party can be quickly informed. A MAN also enables large entities, such as a city government or university, to consolidate resources and reduce inefficiencies in their budget, leading to cost-saving benefits:</P>
    
<div id="MAN3">
<ol id = list2>
<li>It reduces the number of licenses needed for various applications. Resources are shared</li>
<li>You only need one firewall, streamlining your data security, keeping people safer.</li>
<li>It minimizes data entry and data warehousing duplications. Information can up uploaded in one place, and everyone on the network has access</li>
<li>It cuts down mistakes that happen when the left hand (Department A) doesn't know what the right hand (Department B) is doing</li>
<li>The metropolitan area network speed can meet even the toughest data-transfer demands over a large area</li>
</ol> 
</div>

<h2 id="HDIW2">How does it Work</h2>
<p id = "MAN4">Metropolitan area networks connect multiple LANs together through dedicated wired and wireless backbones. A MAN may use a local exchange carrier (LEC) to provide the connections between LANs and may connect to an internet exchange point for high-speed communication between the MAN and the public internet.</p>
